# Toolbox - collection of helper tools from internet
Toolbox - Its brings collection of web-tools which are used by programmers and general people 
very often. 
It is a collection of tools which are used to perform various tasks like
hashing, encyption, compression etc.

### Problem statement:
Well you can find many tools on the internet but the problem is that you have to search for them, try and find the right one.

### Proposed Solution:
I created a website which will have all the tools in one place and will be easy to use.
plus the website will be responsive so that it can be used on mobile devices as well.
I also added many missing features from the existing tools like you can download the output of the tool etc.

### Future Work:
Add more tools and a layer that allows general users to create tools and add them to the website by 
using a template system.

## Project setup
```
npm install

npm run serve
or
npm run dev
```
